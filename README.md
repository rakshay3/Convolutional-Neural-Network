# Convolutional-Neural-Network
A complete implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow, featuring the MNIST dataset. Includes training, evaluation, visualization, confusion matrix, and misprediction analysis.

notebook : contains the implementation of the cnn_model in jupyter notebook 

results : images that contains Example-CNN values(MNIST), model's predicted values with actual value, model's mispredicted value, accuracy plot, confusion matrix.

# CodeStructure

Hereâ€™s a structured version of what the code might look like:
 1. Import Libraries
 2. Load and Normalize Data
 3. Visualize Sample Images
 4. Build the CNN Model
 5. Compile the Model
 6. Train the Model
 7. Evaluate the Model


# Model Result

Test Accuracy: 0.9866 (0.99)
loss: 0.0443
Digit with most mispredictions: 7
Number of mispredictions: 38
